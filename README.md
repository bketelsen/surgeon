# Surgeon

Modify your fork of an upstream repository with surgical precision.

See [IncusScripts](https://github.com/bketelsen/IncusScripts) which uses `surgeon`
to modify [community-scripts for Proxmox](https://github.com/community-scripts/ProxmoxVE)
to run on Incus.

Use `surgeon` to keep your fork up-to-date with an upstream, but make modifications during the process.

For example:

- use the `inject` module to add a license or credit to the upstream
- use the `sed` module to change a function invocation to a different one
- use the `replacefile` module to completely replace a single file

Codemods implement a small-ish interface so it's easy to add new ones. PR's accepted if you find something you need.

``` go
type CodeMod interface {
	Apply(source string, target string, match string, args ...string) error
	Validate(source string, target string, match string, args ...string) error
	Description() string
	Usage() string
}
```
